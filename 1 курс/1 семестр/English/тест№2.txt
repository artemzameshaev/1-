From the history of computer science
The history of computer science predates the invention of the modern digital computer by many centuries. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks have existed since antiquity.
Almost all of the invented tools were based on cog-wheel to fix decimal notation 10 digits. First sketch of 13-digit cog-wheel adder was drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in about 1492.
Wilgelm Schickard built the first mechanical calculator in 1623.
The first real existed mechanical calculus device was designed by Blaise Pascal in 1642. It was 6 (or 8) digital cog-wheel device for adding and subtraction of decimal numbers. In 1673 another 12 digital device was designed by ((Gotfrid))) Wilhelm Leibniz.
Both of these two innovations were used by an ((Englishman)) Charles Babbag. He designed the project of the Analytical engine, a punched-card-controlled calculator. Demonstration program for it was written by Augusta Ada Byron in 1842. To demonstrate how the Analytical Engine would work, Lady Lovelace included in her notes a program for calculating a certain series of numbers. This was the worldâ€™s first computer program.
As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general.
Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1960s, with the creation of the first computer science departments and degree programs. Despite its relatively short history as a formal academic discipline, computer science has made a number of fundamental contributions to science and society.
